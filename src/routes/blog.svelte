	I'm a software engineer specializing in building highly reliable systems and services. Currently I'm studying
	Computer Science at
	<a href="https://gmu.edu/"> George Mason University, </a>
	for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree. However, I have an important role in a wide variety of projects and products
	on the web.
